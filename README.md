Technical task (v2)


Main steps:
1. set up VMware workstation and install ubuntu 18.
2. installed all necessary dependecies. For example apache server, php, mysql database, phpunit and composer(to use phpunit easier), phpmyadmin,also installed sublime 3 with some additional packages that would help coding.
3. a bit of php.ini tampering to set up local webserver
4. drew up database example on paper and how they would be linked.
5. created db and tables using phpmyadmin tool.
6. coding was done and site was created. was sad that frameworks were forbiden. (would be easier to create everything)

p.s. Sorry for not having any unit tests. Just didn't have time to create those yet.

Also did not commit "vendor" folder because that's lot of "composer" files. Those can be downloaded separately via terminal.
